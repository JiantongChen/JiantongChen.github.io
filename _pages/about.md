Hello! I'm Jiantong Chen, currently a researcher at the Embodied Intelligence Center of [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). My research focuses on robotic learning and embodied artificial intelligence, investigating how intelligent systems perceive, interact with, and learn from environments. 
I earned my Master's degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems (2020) from Xidian University, where I was advised by Prof. [Jie Feng](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/fengjie/).
